                <li><strong>Supporting the Academic Excellence of Student Caregivers</strong> Student caregivers are some of the most focused and resourceful students on campus, as demonstrated by their ability to balance school, work, and parental responsibilities. Did you know that 26% of all college students nationwide are raising children?</li>
                <li><strong>CEW+ Annual Advocacy Symposium</strong> CEW+ annually brings together staff, faculty, students, and community members to create change through introspection, dialogue, and action at our advocacy symposium. The goal is to give participants practical tools to better advocate for themselves and others.</li>
